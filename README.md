# Interactive House Price Explanation Dashboard using LIME

An interactive visualization system that explains house price predictions using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).

## Project Overview

This project combines machine learning with explainable AI to help users understand **what drives house prices**. Using the LIME algorithm, we provide transparent, interpretable explanations for individual price predictions.

### Key Features

- **Random Forest Model** trained on 20,640 California housing samples
- **LIME Explanations** showing top features impacting each prediction
- **Interactive Dashboard** built with Streamlit
- **What-If Analysis** - adjust features and see real-time price changes
- **Multi-Market Support** - designed to work with both US and Slovenian data
